I am an economics & data analytics student and a data analyst. I am interested in design, data visualisation, flocking simulations, and software development. This is a portfolio to document interesting personal projects.

## Building the Website
This website was built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with heavily modification from the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme. It is made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). The forked repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/EthanVIII/EthanVIII.github.io).

Learn more and contribute to Jekyll on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).
