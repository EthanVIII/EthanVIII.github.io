I am an economics & data analytics student and a data analyst. I am interested in design, data visualisation, flocking simulations, and software development. This is a portfolio to document interesting personal projects.

## Building the Website
This website was built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) version of and a heavily modified [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme. It made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). The forked repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/EthanVIII/EthanVIII.github.io).
